The ``Haskell Cheat Sheet'' covers the syntax, keywords, and other
language elements of Haskell 98. It is intended for beginning to
intermediate Haskell programmers and can even serve as a memory aid to
experts.

The cheat sheet is distributed as a PDF and literate source file. It
can be downloaded from \url{http://cheatsheet.codeslower.com}.
Spanish and Japanese translations can be found there as well.
